  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    The Offset Archive is a searchable database of every project listed in the
    four major carbon registories: American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate
    Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard, and Verra. These platforms make up the
    majority of the voluntary carbon market and record lists of various carbon
    offsetting projects, as well as the different methodologies that underlie
    them. The voluntary market is one of two distinct domains for carbon
    offsetting today and is open to the public to develop or purchase carbon
    offsetting products. The other domain is the mandatory or “compliance”
    marketplaces that form part of regulatory schemes run by governments and
    which are the basis for reaching international climate commitments. Despite
    high hopes at the most recent COP meeting in 2023 for regulation of
    voluntary carbon market, an agreement on key rules for carbon trading was
    not reached. Voluntary markets remain unregulated by the UN or governmental
    bodies.
